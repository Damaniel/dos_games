Next things to do

- Refactor some of the code 
   - Find opportunities to remove duplicated code   
- Scrollbars on the draw area
- Add structures and support for the overview/progress window
- Add support for proportional text (borrow from SLAC)
- Add text to bottom of screen (use sprintf/text render code from above)
- Add loading screen.  Keep count of loaded elements, use interrupt to draw
