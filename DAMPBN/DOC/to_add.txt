Next things to do

   - Try changing rendering to a layer based thing, where different states
     can specify layers of graphics to draw, instead of the weird things that
     happen in the state/render code right now 

Add 'or ESC' text to the map screen

In the load picture screen invoked from the title menu, highlight the last

 progress file)
