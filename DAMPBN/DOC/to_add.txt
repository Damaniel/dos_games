Next things to do

- Refactor some of the code 
   - Create render.c 
   - Find opportunities to remove duplicated code   
- Scrollbars on the draw area
- Page 1 / Page 2 buttons
- Add 'states'.  Just one state (in game) for now 
- Add structures and support for the overview/progress window
- Add support for proportional text (borrow from SLAC)
- Add text to bottom of screen (use sprintf/text render code from above)
