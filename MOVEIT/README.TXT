Move-it, Man!  A box pushing puzzle game using the lo-res (160x100) 16
color CGA mode.

Current features:
- Uses the 108 levels from Boxxle (the Gameboy version of this game)
- Allows the player to continue from the most recently started level
- Undo!

Issues:
- Target move and par time counts are all placeholders, so it's impossible
  to make the target time or move count for nearly every level past the
  first couple.  These values will come through trial and error.
- No polish at all.  No animations, no transitions, no sound, nothing.

Controls:

- Arrow keys - move around
- U - undo.  Allows you to rewind up to 50 moves, but each undo also itself
             counts as a move.
- R - reset.  Moves the player and all of the boxes back into their starting
              positions.
- N/P - debug functions that warp you to the next or previous level.
