# dos_games
Various MS-DOS-compatible games (some in CGA text 'graphics' mode, the rest in other assorted standard modes)

## Overview 

These games include the following:

* Tetris: 'Yet Another Tetris Clone' - a game done in 1997 (when I was still in high school) using an early version of the Allegro graphics library
* LOCGAED: A sprite sheet editor for the CGA 160x100, 16-color text-based graphics mode
* DAMANOID: An in-progress brick breaker clone that uses the CGA 160x100 16-color mode
* MOVEIT: Move-it, Man! - An in-progress Sokoban clone that uses the CGA 160x100 16-color mode
* SLAC: Secret Legacy of the Ancient Caves - an in-progress roguelike targeting protected mode PCs with VGA
* MINIBAND: Daminiband - an in-progress attempt to create a basic EGA roguelike that can run on a potato.

(Yes - there's a lot of 'in progress' stuff up there.  Move-it, Man is playable from beginning to end, missing just reasonable par times for the second half of the levels, Damanoid is far enough along to play a few levels, LOCGAED is feature complete, YATC is complete, and SLAC/MINIBAND are early in development.)
