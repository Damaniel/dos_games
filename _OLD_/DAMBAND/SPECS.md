## Gems

Gems can be any shape, but can be no larger overall than 6x6.  The gem can be moved anywhere in the gem box, but can't be rotated.  

Every stat and skill available to the player is available in every gem color, but skills and stats normally associated with a particular stat type will tend to be smallest in that type's color.  For example, a STR+1 gem is very small as a red gem, a little larger as a green gem, and larger still as a yellow or blue gem.
