README - Yet Another Tetris Clone ver 0.9999999

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Warning:  For the time being, PLEASE do not distribute over the Internet....
certain features of the game may be copyrighted to other individuals, and
in an effort to avoid a lawsuit, I'd like to figure out exactly what needs
to be given credit.....but, by all means, if you have a copy of this game,
PLAY IT!  That's what it's for!
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

OK....the game is now up to version 0.9999999...essentially what this means
is that it's finished....or at least as finished as I plan to make it for the
time being....in the future, there will probably be a couple more things to
add, and there are definitely bugs to fix (nothing serious, though), so the
game is playable, but not yet perfect....

System requirements:

     - A 386SX or better processor (a 486 or higher strongly recommended)
     - 4 megs of RAM (8 if trying to run under Win95)
     - (Optional) a Soundblaster or compatible sound card
     - CWSDPMI, which is included with the distribution (if you aren't
        running this game from Windows)

Neat features:

     - Music and sound!  (Well, at least I consider these to be nifty...)
     - Choose which way the pieces rotate
     - Both A and B games are playable!
     - Colorful backgrounds which change on the fly
     - Multiple songs to choose from
     - Much more! (Play it yourself and find out....)

How to install the game:

   The game can be played directly from the floppy disk, but, for your sake
and mine, PLEASE DON'T do this!  Run the install program that can be found
on this disk.  To do this, change to your floppy drive and run the program
SETUP.EXE.  This is all automated, so just press enter when prompted to.

How to play the game:

   This isn't a tutorial as to the features and rules of Tetris...if you
don't know how the game is played...then I feel quite sorry for you......

How to play THIS VERSION of the game (ie.  the keys and stuff...)

   OK...you know how to play Tetris, so here's how to play 'Yet Another
Tetris Clone' (hereon referred to as YATC)....

   To start the game, change to the game directory (c:\seatet), and run
   TET.exe from the DOS prompt.  If you have not run the game before, you
   will be asked a couple of easy questions to set up your sound card. You
   will only be asked these questions once, not each time you play.

 -   To move the piece left or right, press the left and right arrows,
          respectively.
 -   To rotate the pieces, press the down arrow.
 -   To make the piece fall faster, press the up arrow.
 -   To drop the piece, press the space bar.
 -   To toggle the 'next piece' display on or off, press 'N'.

 That's about all there is to it.  If you manage to get a high score,
just type in your name (8 letters max) when prompted, and see your name
in yellow!  Fun, huh?

Sound:

  This game supports all Soundblasters and 100 percent compatibles.  If you
have a SB, then prepare to experience a full multimedia experience (well,
not quite, but there's music and sound effects....)  The game has 3 pieces
of music to choose from, and if you're not happy with them, just go find
your favorite MOD files (yes, old fashioned Amiga style .MOD's), and rename
them tune1.mod, tune2.mod or tune3.mod, and place them in the game directory.


Well....that's enough of a README for now...I just hate typing these things..
and besides, you should be PLAYING MY GAME, not reading this file...so, go!
:)


YATC is copyrighted freeware.  This means that you are free to distribute
this game to anybody, but you can't sell it for profit......since I'm not
making anything off of this game, neither should you.....so, the moral of
this?  Give this to everybody (well, not everybody...but pass it around a
little....), and enjoy the game.  I enjoyed making it.

Special thanks to Shawn Hargreaves, the creator of the Allegro game library
for DJGPP (the library used for all of the graphics routines in the game),
and to everybody that I know who didn't have a direct role in the design of
this game (but who I feel I should mention anyway....) -- Bao, Damon, Becky,
Chris, Savanna, and so on....I know who you all are.......

Tetris is a copyright of it's respective owners.  It is based on a design by
Alexey Pazhitnov, so give him thanks, too, for without him, there would be
no Tetris (nor would there be hundreds of Tetris clones, either....) ;)
